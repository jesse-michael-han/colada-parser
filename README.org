#+TITLE: colada-parser

** About

~colada-parser~ is a parser for [[https://github.com/formalabstracts/CNL-CIC][Colada]], a controlled natural language (CNL) for the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC). It is still experimental and under heavy development.

This work was carried out as part of the [[https://formalabstracts.github.io][Formal Abstracts]] project.

** Project organization
The project is contained inside ~src/Colada~. ~src/Colada/Basic/~ (so modules in the ~Colada.Basic~ namespace) contains low-level parser combinators (~Core.hs~), utilities for managing the parser state (~State.hs~ and ~ParserState.hs~), and low-level parsers for the basic terminals of the grammar (literals, tokens, punctuation, delimiters) (~Token.hs~). These are all re-exported by ~Colada.Basic.Basic~.

The topmost file in the project is ~Colada.Tests~. This file imports and re-exports every other file in the project, and so should be loaded in a REPL when interactively developing the parser. The highest-level non-testing file is ~Colada.ProgramText~. This imports all other parts of the grammar. The basic unit of a Colada document is a ~TextItem~. The entire document must be parsed as a ~ProgramText~, which wraps a list of ~TextItem~ s.

~Colada.PhraseList~ contains utilities for dynamically extending the ~colada-parser~ using a simple markup language (tokens postfixed with a question mark can be optionally parsed, and ~(tk1 | tk2 | ... | tkn)~ will parse any of the ~|~-separated tokens ). Marked-up input is parsed into the ~ParserMarkUp~ datatype, from which ~colada-parser~ generates a parser for later use in the text. The parser which handles the conversion to ~ParserMarkUp~ ignores OCaml-style line and block comments.

** Build instructions

To build ~colada-parser~, you must have the Haskell tool ~stack~ installed (see [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][here]]). Navigate to the project directory and run ~stack build~. After building the parser, you can test it on a CNL-compliant text file with ~stack exec colada path_to/my_file~. If the parse is successful, the parse tree will be written to ~my_file.parsed~ in the same directory as ~my_file~.

For example, ~stack exec colada test/test.txt~ should succeed.

Note: in the output, error messages may appear twice in a row with the same offset.
